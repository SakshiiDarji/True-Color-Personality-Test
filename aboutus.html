   <h1>Why Personality Tests?</h1>  <!--Title main-->
  
    <p>A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individual’s distinct 
        personality traits.<br>
        In most instances, your personality will influence 
        relationships with your family, friends, and classmates and contribute to your 
        health and well-being.<br> 
        Teachers can administer a personality test in class to 
        help your children discover their strengths and developmental needs.<br> 
        The driving force behind administering a personality test is to open up lines of 
        communication and bring students together to have a higher appreciation for 
        one another.<br> 
        A personality test can provide guidance to teachers of what 
        teaching strategies will be the most effective for their students.

        One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality 
        Test.<br> 
        This personality test asks a serious of questions to rate your likes and 
        dislikes.<br> 
        The test will then rate your personality as either a blue, green, orange 
        or gold personality type.<br> 
        You may be a combination of two colors, but usually 
        a student will exhibit one primary color.</p><br> 
        <p id="dark">               
            <!--giving class-dark so that can design differently in the middle with different background color-->
        A personality test is not a means to type cast a student, but it allows teachers to understand the personality 
        attributes associated with various students.<br> 
        You will operate as one primary 
        color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental 
        factors can shift your personality type for short intervals.<br> 
        As a rule of thumb, you should recognize your strong attributes and keep in mind the 
        attributes that irritate people.<br>
       
        Teachers should disseminate a personality test to their children the first week 
        of school.<br> 
        A personality test is a fun exercise for the class and will enable 
        the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and activities for their students.</p>
